# DATSCapstone23
Hi, my name is Rohith Pydi and I am a current undergraduate in my senior year at the George Washington University. This repository reflects my data science capstone project titled "Machine Learning for Non-skin Cancer Detection". The overall goal of this project is to implement predictive modeling based on a dataset (linked below) to provide accurate predictions for the likelihood of individuals having non-skin cancer.
